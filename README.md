## Problem Statement

We are tackling the issue of users trying to purchase an item (NFT) from a marketplace such that the item(NFT) is being sold in a particular digital currency/token but they have another digital currency/token available in their wallet, so rather than swapping their digital currency/token to the token that the marketplace requires, they borrow with collateral and pay back later.

## Solution
